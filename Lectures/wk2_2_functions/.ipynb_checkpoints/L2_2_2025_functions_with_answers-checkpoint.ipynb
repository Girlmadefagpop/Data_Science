    "> As a part of the preflight checklist, Glenn asked engineers to “get the girl”—Johnson—to run the same numbers through the same equations that had been programmed into the computer, but by hand, on her desktop mechanical calculating machine. “If she says they’re good,’” Katherine Johnson remembers the astronaut saying, “then I’m ready to go.” Glenn’s flight was a success, and marked a turning point in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in space.

    "From the same source (and connecting to our gender pay-gap discussion):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 1953, a “computer” was someone who performed computations, or mathematical formulas. So, Johnson joining a computer group at NACA meant she was working as someone who could perform the precise calculations needed for spaceflight. The term computer being used for a human had been in use since the 17th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At some point in the 19th century, work as a computer became gendered. This was party to reduce costs. During inequitable times, women were paid far less for this essential work than a man in a similar role would be.\n",

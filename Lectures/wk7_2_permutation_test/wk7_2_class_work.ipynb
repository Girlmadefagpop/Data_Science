    "\n",
    "- We apply our simulation logic:\n",
    "  - Decide how many beer/water experiments to simulate (a low number first, then increase when your code is checked)\n",
    "  - Save an array with space to store results\n",
    "  - Make a loop\n",
    "    - simulate one experiment\n",
    "    - Here we do this by mixing up one column\n",
    "      - ('permutation' means mixing up the outcomes)\n",
    "    - Hint: You mix up the conditions you are testing (e.g. beer/water)\n",
    "      - make sure you understand why\n",
    "      - If beer/water doesn't matter, then mixing will not change the result\n",
    "      - If they **do** matter than the simulated world will look very different from the real world\n",
    "    - By mixing, we are simulating a world where beer and water are the same\n",
    "    - Calculate the difference between the beer and water conditions\n",
    "    - Store that result\n",
    "    - repeat\n",
    "- Compare the beer/water difference from the simulated 'no differencee' world with the real world\n",
    "  - Plot a distribution of the simulated beer/water differences\n",
    "    - These should cluster around 0\n",
    "  - Plot the real word difference\n",
    "  - Calculate a probability -- How likely was the real world difference in the simulated world?"
